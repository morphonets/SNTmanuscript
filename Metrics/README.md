## Metrics

This directory contains scripts that describes the distribtuitons for all of SNT metrics computed upon the manuscript submission. It does so, by comparing the two types of mouse PT neurons from the Secondary somatomotor area described in Fig. 6 of [Winnubst et al. 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31495573/):

- Group 1: Layer 6 PT neurons projecting to the Thalamus
- Group 2: Layer 5 PT neurons projecting to the Medulla 

These two groups are also analyzed in Fig. S7. The  MouseLight IDs of the cells is as follows:

| Thalamus-Projecting                                          | Medulla Projecting                                           |

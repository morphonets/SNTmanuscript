# SNT Manuscript Scripts

This repository hosts the scripts that were used to assemble the figures of the [SNT publication](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.13.179325v1). Each figure is associated with a sub-folder. When relevant, further details are provided on sub-folders `README` files. Please open an [issue](https://github.com/morphonets/SNTmanuscript/issues) on this repository if you run into problems.



### Requirements

These instructions assume that you have installed the most recent version of Fiji and have subscribed to the Neuroanatomy update site, as detailed in the [SNT documentation](https://imagej.net/SNT#Installation). Scripts relying on sciview/Cx3D functionality, also require the optional subscription to the *SciView-Unstable* update site.
